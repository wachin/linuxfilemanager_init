# Linux File Manager

Lightweight modular file manager for Linux built with Python 3 and PyQt6.

This project aims to provide a familiar, efficient file management workflow while staying fast, simple, and Linux-friendly.

## AI Agents Welcome — Help Continue This Project

Are you a developer who writes code with an AI assistant? This repository is prepared for exactly that: it ships guide files that AI coding agents read (and many follow automatically), so you and your agent can start contributing right away.

- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) — canonical conventions for AI agents and contributors (golden rule, current architecture, how to test).
- [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) — quick-start guide for Claude Code and other agents (points to `AGENTS.md`).
- [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](.github/copilot-instructions.md) — instructions for GitHub Copilot.
- [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) — how to contribute: rules, tests, and pull requests.

**You are invited to continue this development.** The full plan lives in [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md): phases 0–13 plus a prioritized backlog. Pick any open task aligned with your skills, open an issue or a pull request, and help build the best file manager for Linux together. Every contribution — code, tests, documentation, translations, or ideas — is welcome.

## Highlights

- Modular PyQt6 application structure
- Multiple view modes: icons, list, details, compact
- Quick Access, bookmarks, recent locations, and tabbed navigation
- XDG User Directories support for localized and user-customized standard folders
- Core file operations: copy, move, rename, delete, trash, create folder/file
- Search in the current folder with filters
- Preview and properties panels
- Archive extraction and ZIP creation
- Undo/redo support for several file operations
- Desktop integration through `xdg-open`, MIME detection, and default app handling
- Debian packaging skeleton and AppStream metadata

## Project Status

`Linux File Manager` is currently a working prototype under active development.

Already implemented:

- Main window, sidebar, workspace, preview panel, and status bar
- File navigation history and multiple tabs
- Context menus and toolbar actions
- XDG-compliant Quick Access that resolves Desktop, Downloads, Documents, Music, Pictures, and Videos from the system instead of hardcoded English folder names
- Bookmarks kept separate from built-in Quick Access places by default
- Search, bookmarks, trash, properties, and basic archive support
- Configurable UI preferences such as font and window size

Planned and tracked:

- See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the full roadmap, phases, and backlog.

## Requirements

- Linux
- Python 3.11+
- PyQt6

Recommended desktop integration packages on Debian 12 / MX Linux 23:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install \
  python3 python3-pyqt6 python3-pyqt6.qtsvg \
  qt6ct \
  xdg-utils shared-mime-info desktop-file-utils \
  breeze-icon-theme papirus-icon-theme hicolor-icon-theme \
  gvfs gvfs-common gvfs-daemons gvfs-fuse gvfs-libs gvfs-backends \
  cifs-utils nfs-common sshfs davfs2 \
  p7zip-full unrar-free zip unzip binutils \
  qt6-translations-l10n
```

These packages enable:

- desktop file and MIME integration
- network locations such as SMB, SFTP, WebDAV, and mounted shares
- practical ZIP, 7z, RAR, TAR, and `.deb` handling
- Qt 6 icon-theme selection through `qt6ct`
- recommended icon themes such as `Breeze` and `Papirus`
- Qt translation support where available

### Recommended Python 3 libraries (already present on Debian 13)

These packages are commonly available in the repositories and are already
installed on the reference system; the application uses them when their
feature area is implemented, so installing them unlocks those capabilities:

```bash
sudo apt install \
  python3-magic python3-puremagic \
  python3-pil python3-psutil \
  python3-docx python3-openpyxl python3-pypdf \
  python3-chardet python3-charset-normalizer \
  python3-dateutil python3-mutagen \
  python3-libarchive-c python3-brotli \
  python3-pyqt6.qtpdf
```

What they enable:

- real content-based MIME detection (`python3-magic`, `python3-puremagic`)
  instead of extension guessing
- EXIF metadata and image handling (`python3-pil`)
- system/disk information for the status bar (`python3-psutil`)
- text extraction from `.docx`/`.xlsx`/PDF for previews and content search
  (`python3-docx`, `python3-openpyxl`, `python3-pypdf`)
- text-encoding detection for the preview panel (`python3-chardet`,
  `python3-charset-normalizer`)
- audio metadata (`python3-mutagen`)
- archive inspection and extra codecs (`python3-libarchive-c`,
  `python3-brotli`)
- PDF preview rendering (`python3-pyqt6.qtpdf`)

### Optional Python 3 libraries (now installed; enable future features)

These were installed on the reference system to unlock future work (natural
name sorting, filesystem watching, keyring credentials, media metadata, EXIF,
fast hashing, FFmpeg bindings, Zstandard, remote/cloud backends, duplicate
engines, QR/SVG helpers and XDG trash):

```bash
sudo apt install \
  python3-natsort \
  python3-watchdog python3-pyinotify \
  python3-keyring python3-secretstorage \
  python3-pymediainfo \
  python3-piexif python3-exifread \
  python3-filetype \
  python3-xxhash \
  python3-av \
  python3-zstandard \
  python3-qrcode python3-svglib python3-cairosvg \
  python3-send2trash \
  rclone \
  python3-paramiko \
  ffmpegthumbnailer \
  rmlint fdupes rdfind \
  trash-cli
```

What they enable (future work):

- natural name sorting (`python3-natsort`)
- filesystem watching beyond `QFileSystemWatcher` (`python3-watchdog`,
  `python3-pyinotify`)
- storing network credentials in the desktop keyring (`python3-keyring`,
  `python3-secretstorage`)
- media metadata without subprocess calls (`python3-pymediainfo`)
- EXIF read/write helpers (`python3-piexif`, `python3-exifread`)
- lightweight file-type detection (`python3-filetype`)
- fast hashing for the duplicate finder (`python3-xxhash`)
- FFmpeg bindings for video sampling (`python3-av`)
- Zstandard compression support (`python3-zstandard`)
- QR/SVG helpers if "share as QR" or extra SVG previews are added
  (`python3-qrcode`, `python3-svglib`, `python3-cairosvg`)
- XDG trash helper (`python3-send2trash`, `trash-cli`)
- remote/cloud backends (`rclone`, `python3-paramiko`)
- video thumbnailing (`ffmpegthumbnailer`)
- duplicate-hash engines for the duplicate finder (`rmlint`, `fdupes`,
  `rdfind`)

### Optional external tools

- `ultracopier` (`/usr/bin/ultracopier`) — advanced graphical copy system with
  queueing, pause/resume and speed control. The file manager keeps its native
  copy engine as default, but can delegate copy/move to Ultracopier when the
  user prefers it (see the ROADMAP section *10.2 Copia/movido alternativo
  opcional con Ultracopier*).

The full rationale and the per-package verdicts are documented in the
ROADMAP section *Inventario de paquetes y utilidades aprovechables*.

The application also includes extra fallback icon loading from `lfmapp/ui/icons.py`:
- first it uses `QIcon.fromTheme()` for the active Qt icon theme,
- if the theme does not provide a matching name, it searches installed
  icon theme files under the system icon paths,
- and it uses common alias names for compatibility between themes.

## How to change the icon theme for Linux File Manager

To change the icon theme for Linux File Manager when using Qt 6 theme icons:

1. Run `qt6ct`.
2. Open the `Icon theme` tab and wait for the installed themes to load.
3. Choose a theme and click `Apply`.
4. Close Linux File Manager and open it again.

The application will then use the selected system icon theme.

## Quick Start

Run from the repository root:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

![](images/01-lfmapp.png)

Or install locally and use the console entry point:

```bash
python3 -m pip install .
linuxfm
```

## Development Setup

Install the application dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m pip install PyQt6
```

Install test dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m pip install pytest
```

Run the test suite:

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q
```

During active UI and config development, it can also be useful to remove:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.local/share/linux-file-manager/
```

This forces Linux File Manager to recreate its saved state from current defaults. Without that reset, older saved configuration can hide newly added settings or make recent fixes appear not to take effect immediately after restarting the program.

### Reference sources: the Thunar git submodule

The repository pins the sources of the [Thunar file manager](https://github.com/xfce-mirror/thunar) as a git submodule under [`third-party/thunar`](third-party/thunar/) (`org.xfce.*` code, GPL-2+). They are a **read-only reference** for studying how a mature Linux file manager is built (GIO/gvfs integration, icon themes, transfers, thumbnails, D-Bus activation, …) — they are **never built, installed or copied**; Linux File Manager only re-expresses the interaction logic (see the *Thunar as a study reference* section of [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) and “Sources of Inspiration” below).

To get the submodule when cloning the repository:

```bash
# Option A — clone with the submodule from the start (recommended):
git clone --recurse-submodules <repository-url>

# Option B — already cloned without it:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

To update the pinned reference later (e.g. after a new Thunar release):

```bash
git -C third-party/thunar fetch
git -C third-party/thunar checkout <tag-or-commit>
git add third-party/thunar .gitmodules
```

## Configuration

User settings are stored in:

```text
~/.local/share/linux-file-manager/config.json
```

Related application data is also stored under:

```text
~/.local/share/linux-file-manager/
```

This directory can contain:

- `config.json` for preferences and UI state
- `bookmarks.json` for user-created bookmarks only
- `tags.db` for persistent file tags
- `extensions/` for user extensions
- `vault/` for vault-related data

Examples of configurable settings:

- window width and height
- remember window size
- global font family, style, and size
- sidebar and preview visibility
- hidden files, file extensions, and selection checkboxes
- preferred terminal for `Open in Terminal`

## XDG User Directories

Linux File Manager now follows the FreeDesktop XDG User Directories specification for standard user folders.

This means `Quick Access` resolves:

- Home
- Desktop
- Downloads
- Documents
- Music
- Pictures
- Videos

from the actual system configuration rather than assuming English folder names like `~/Desktop` or `~/Documents`.

Resolution order:

1. `xdg-user-dir`
2. `~/.config/user-dirs.dirs`

Only existing directories are shown, duplicate paths are avoided, and user-customized or localized folders such as `~/Escritorio`, `~/Documentos`, or `~/Bureau` are supported automatically.

By design:

- `Quick Access` contains the built-in XDG locations.
- `Bookmarks` contains only user-created bookmarks.
- `This Computer` focuses on Home, `/`, drives, removable media, and Trash.
- `Recents` remains dedicated to recent files and folders.

You can change these settings from:

- `Tools > Preferences...`
- `View > Font Size`

## Resetting the Program

If you want to reset Linux File Manager to a clean state, you can inspect and remove its saved files from:

```text
~/.local/share/linux-file-manager/
```

Common reset actions:

- delete `~/.local/share/linux-file-manager/config.json` to reset preferences and window/UI state
- delete the whole `~/.local/share/linux-file-manager/` directory to remove all saved application data

After deleting these files, start the program again and it will recreate the missing configuration with default values.
On first launch after a reset, Linux File Manager now recreates its core app data automatically, including `config.json`, `bookmarks.json`, `tags.db`, and the `extensions/` and `vault/` directories.

## Packaging

The repository includes:

- Python package metadata in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml)
- Desktop integration files in [data/linux-file-manager.desktop](data/linux-file-manager.desktop) and [data/linux-file-manager.metainfo.xml](data/linux-file-manager.metainfo.xml)
- Debian packaging scaffolding in [debian/](debian)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Useful areas include:

- UI and workflow polish
- Linux desktop integration
- performance improvements for large folders
- automated tests
- packaging and release automation

Before opening larger changes, check [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) to align with current priorities, and read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the project conventions used by AI agents and contributors.
